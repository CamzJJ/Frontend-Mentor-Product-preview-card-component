## My process

  I first planned out my build. What was going to go where, how I wanted to group everything together in the HTML and how I was going to use CSS to position everything and style them.

  Once I Had an idea of how I was going to put everything together I then began to structure every thing in the HTML.

  Finally I moved on to the CSS to style and position everything according to the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I learned by through this challenge was use of the command line to push and pull my work to and from github whist also practicing basic HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I want to improve my skill on the command line to manage versions of my work along with using compilers like scss to improve my speed.

I also use EMs, REMs, and % instead of fixed measurements like PXs for better responsive designs
